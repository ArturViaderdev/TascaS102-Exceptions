# Task S1.02 - Exceptions
## Level 1:
I tested the personalized exception that is thrown when the list is empty, and it needs a throws.
Later, I changed the exception for a runtime exception and the throws is not needed.

The runtime exceptions or not checked exceptions are not detected by the compiler. It not need the throws and if you not put the try catch the program stops and the error message is shown in the console.

## Level 2 Secure reading from the keyboard
The program gets data from the user using the keyboard and it checks that the input is correct using standard exceptions and personalized exceptions.

## Level 3
Application that administrates the reserved seats of a cinema managing exceptions.
